# Weather-Dashboard

## **Description**

I created a simple clean Weather Dashboard to enable a check the current and forecasted 5-day weathr in their chosen city.

The desired outcome was to allow for the following to happen::

-When the page laods, the user can search for their chosen city;  
-The browser will show the current weather result for the chosen city;  
-The browser will display the 5-day weather forecast for the chosen city;  
-The recent search history of chosen cities would show in a list, allowing the user to click them again to view the information again;  
-The recently searched cities would persist between refreshes of a page  

Languages ued to create the applictaion were:  
-HTML  
-CSS  
-Vanilla JavaScript  
-JQuery, incorporating day.js  
-Server-side API (Openweathermap)

The deployed page can be found here: https://nadiafortune.github.io/WorkDay-Scheduler/

A screenshot of the deployed page is below:

## **Installation**

The application runs within the browser and events are saved when the user types into the timeblocks.


## **Usage**

As above

## **Credits**

The following resources were used to research the coding funcionality for the successful deployment of the application: YouTube, w3schools, MDN, JQuery CDN, and day.js

I did not use a tutor guidance session for this challenge.
